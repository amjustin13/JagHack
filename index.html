  <!--BEGIN FAQ QUESTIONS IN COLUMNS *use col-md-4 -->
  <!-- New Question -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>Who can attend?</h3>
    <p>This is our first hackathon and we want all IUPUI students to part of it! This event is for experienced hackers and beginners alike. To give equal opportunity to all hackers, admission will be based on a lottery of applicants.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- New Question -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>What will I eat?</h3>
    <p>Thanks to our amazing sponsors we will be providing food, snacks and drinks (non-alcoholic... sorry) to all hackers during the 24 hour competition. While you focus on crating the most amazing hacks the world has ever seen we will focus on making
      sure you are fuelled up and ready to go!</p>
  </div>

  <!-- New Question -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
    <p>Bring your IUPUI issued JagTag, a laptop and your charger. That's all that you really need! Some other things we suggest that you bring are: a sleeping bag, a fresh set of clothes and a tooth brush. Although we would love to see your juiced up desktop
      we would preffer that you leave it at home(we have limited outlets and space).</p>
  </div>

  <!--New Question -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>How much will it cost me?</h3>
    <p>JAGHACK is absolutely free to all hackers that are accepted to the competition! Register online, get selected, come over, hack, win some prizes maybe. Does not get much better than that!</p>
  </div>

  <!--New Question -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>How do teams work?</h3>
    <p>Teams work two ways: register Han style, or register with your squad. Teams will have a maximum of 4 participants. If one of the team members is selected in the lottery, all participants become admited to the event. You create a team by specifying
      the same team name during registration phase. If you preffer to register Solo you will have your chance to meet your Chewy during the first hours of the event.</p>
  </div>

  <!--New Question -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>What should I make?</h3>
    <p>Anything that starts with: "Wouldn't it be cool if..." That awesome project that you have had in the backburner for a while... Creative and innovative hacks are the life of the hackathon culture, open your mind and explore new things! You can come
      with an idea in mind, but you should not start building or coding anything before the event starts. All projects at JAGHACK should be started at the event.</p>
  </div>

  <!--New Question -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>Will there be prizes?</h3>
    <p>Although the hackathon culture is all about the hacking, collaboration, learning, and just a big group of people getting together to do what they love... Yes we will
	have prizes! Your sleepless efforts will be rewarded! More info on judging criteria and prizes soon.</p>

  <!--New Question -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>What the heck is a hackathon?</h3>
    <p>From <a href = "https://mlh.io/faq">MLH</a>: <q>A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”.
	Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build &
	share their creations over the course
	of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.
	You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in CS</q></p>
